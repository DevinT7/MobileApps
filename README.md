Novus - Habit/Schedule Tracker App
Aarav Dua, Saideep Katragadda, Devin Thenuwara
The goal of this product is to help students that need to organize assignments but also need a place to document their mental wellbeing to ensure they are feeling well. This will be done by using a journal feature where they can record their mood every day, and go back and edit it if they feel the need to. This will help them realize how they are feeling and can even share their journal to others (such as their therapist or another adult). 
The sturcture of this application has 4 screens that the user can swipe through. There is a calendar page, a journal page, a quotes page, and a map where the user can explore things to do around them. The data will be stored in the memory of the user's device. We originally wanted to use a database but for now are attempting to implement the functionality using local memory. This information will be kept up-to-date by using the device's date and time to keep track of the assignments per day, and we will also push updates to ensure everything is working smoothly.
